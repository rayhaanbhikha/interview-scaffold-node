# Hopin Node Interview

Welcome to the Hopin Node interview scaffold! Before we hop on a call, ensure your setup is ready:

## Notes

`server.js` is a lightweight [express.js](https://expressjs.com/) scaffold.
Rest assured we are not looking for in-depth express.js knowledge. The APIs you build do not require much framework-specific knowledge.

If you are encountering issues during your setup, be sure to reach out to your interviewer for help :)

## Setup

1. Ensure you have `node` and `npm` installed on your machine.
2. `npm install`
3. Make sure you install your favorite persistent DB before the video call and have it running locally (Mongo, Postgres, MySQL, etc.).

## Run

`npm run dev`

Hit `http://localhost:3000/` and ensure you see the JSON `{ "hello": "world" }` returned.


## What we are OK with

1. You installing your own backend framework of choice
2. You installing npm packages of your choice
3. You installing your favorite persistent DB
